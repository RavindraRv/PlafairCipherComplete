Implement the encryption as well as the decryption of the following cipher. The encryption works as
follows:
1. Consider a word (without any space) as a plaintext. (Input)
2. Adjust the length of the plaintext and handle the repetition of letter (if present) according to the
rule of the Playfair cipher. If there is any J in the word convert it to I. Let the final word be ∆.
3. Print the word ∆. (Output)
4. Consider a word as input and convert J (if any) to I and consider that converted word as the key
K1. (Input)
5. Generate the 5 × 5 key matrix of the Playfair cipher from K1 and print it. (Output)
6. Encrypt ∆ using the Playfair cipher where the key is K1. Let the ciphertext be C1. Print the
ciphertext C1. (Output)
7. Encrypt C1 using the Affine cipher where the key is K2 = (11, 15) ∈ Z26 × Z26. Let the ciphertext
be C2. Print the ciphertext C2. (Output)
8. Encrypt C2 using the Shift cipher where the key is K3 (0 ≤ K2 ≤ 25). Let the ciphertext be C3.
Print the ciphertext C3. (Output)
Now you have to think on the decryption to write the code for the decryption. If the code is correct then
the decrypted text after doing the Playfair cipher decryption should match with ∆. You have to print
all the middle layered decrypted texts in the code.
